# Algorithms are usually used for improve the calculation of different matematical operations, and
# there is a hole field in maths for that named as numerical analysis. One key operation that must
# be done in linear algebra for different purposues is the matrix multiplication. The basic
# algorithm to compute the multiplication of two matrices is equal to the dot product of them,
# Z =  A Â· B  each one of size nxn.
# The new matrix will be compouse by nxn products calculated as follows
#
# Z_{i,j} = sum_{i = 1}^{n}  A[i,k] * B[j,k]
#
# input: A matrix nxn denoted as A = [ [a_{1},.., a_{n}]_{1}, [a_{1},.., a_{n}], ...,  [a_{1},.., a_{n}]_{n}] where [[x]]
# x is one row of the matrix.
# input: A matrix nxn denoted as B = [ [b_{1},.., b_{n}]_{1}, [b_{1},.., b_{n}], ...,  [b_{1},.., b_{n}]_{n}] where [[x]]
# x is one row of the matrix.
#
# output: a matrix Z  Z = [ [z_{1,1},.., z_{1,n}], [z_{2,1},.., b_{2,n}], ...,  [b_{n,1},.., b_{n,n}]]

# Once the intuition drives to the brute force algorithm you may notice that this algorithm takes O(n^3) which means is not
# very good, then the magic question "Can we do better" yes, and there is a famous algorithm called Strassens agorthim
# thanks to the professor Volker strassen who publish the following algorithm in 1969 and proves that there is a way to reduce
# the 8 number of basics operations to compute a 2x2 matix. This idea then suggest that if an nxn matrix can be divided and
# recursively computed somehow as a 2x2 matrix the strassen algorithm will solve the nxn problem. Indeed this is a divide
# and conquer algorithm and how the strassen algorithm works.
#
# In order to uderstand better the recursion behind the strassen algorithm the next example is an implementation of a matrix
# multiplication following the divide and conquer principle, not yet the strassen solution. What needs to be taken into
# account is that an nxn matrix can be splited into 4 n/4 x n/4 matrices, and this porces can be done until you get a 2x2
# matrix that requires 8 operations each.
