# Insertion sort:i
#
# The insertion sort is a common algorithm  that emulates the natural way in which humans
# sort things like a deck of cards. This algorithm improves the bubble sort and the selection
# sort eventhough its running time is O(n^2) as well. In comparison to the bubble sort, insertion sort
# do not swap elements reducing the amount of work of taking an element in the possition i to the position
# i + x where x is the final destination. On the other hand insertion sort improves slection sort in average time
# due to this sorting algorithm is not looking for a particular element such as the minimum avoiding to
# pass through the elements of the initial array in this case only the first element of the base array
# is taken and then compared with the remaining elements in the new array.
#
# input: a n element array (A)
# output: an array with all the elements of A sorted
#
# Pseudo code:
# (1). do steps 2 to 5 until A is depleted
# (2). Shift the first element of A array
# (3). place the shifted element in its corresponding place
#      given that follows the sorted rule.
#      (4). if new array is an empty array pop shifted array,
#      (5). else introduce shifted element where the following
#           rule is accomplished: Shifted element must  be
#           grater than left element and lower that next right
#           element.
